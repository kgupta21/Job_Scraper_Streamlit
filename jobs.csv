The base salary range considers many factors including, but not limited to experience, education, and training, including any collective agreement requirements for union represented positions. It is not typical for the salary to be offered near the top of the range, and salary is dependent on numerous factors. For management roles, the base salary range does not represent the total compensation package. The total compensation package for regular full\\-time management roles includes pay\\-for\\-performance programs for annual and medium time periods. Maintaining a high\\-performance culture and excellence is a core expectation of every member of our leadership team and is rewarded through the established compensation framework.  


OPG is committed to employment equity. As such, we encourage applicants from equity\\-seeking communities (Indigenous Peoples, racialized persons, persons with disabilities, and women). We strongly believe that alleviating the under\\-representation of equity\\-seeking individuals will create a stronger OPG team and allow us to better serve the needs of our diverse communities.  


In order to fulfill the above\\-mentioned purpose, priority in hiring may be given to qualified persons who self\\-identify as a member of equity\\-seeking groups as identified in the application process. This initiative constitutes a special program under the Human Rights Code/Canadian Human Rights Act.","","https://ca.indeed.com/cmp/Ontario-Power-Generation","https://d2q79iu7y748jz.cloudfront.net/s/_squarelogo/256x256/bd8b536aa8005f49dfbb68ea5de74f6c","http://opg.com","Toronto, ON","Decline to state","Decline to state","Ontario Power Generation (OPG) is the province’s largest clean power generator and a clean technology leader."
